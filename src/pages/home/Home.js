                Since the 1970â€™s health professionals have known of a lack of primary care physicians
                in the Greater Pacific Northwest region.
                As the only accredited medical school in the area, the task fell on the UW School of Medicine
                to solve this problem.
                      </p>



              <p class="flow-text">
                Over the next decades the School of Medicine would create the
                          <b>WWAMI initiative</b>, an innovative approach to promoting health care careers in underserved
areas with targeted youth outreach and medical residencies.
                      </p>

              <h3>But there's a problem...</h3>

              <p class="flow-text">
                No one knows where this outreach is working and what areas need help. Students fall off the map, programs can't collaborate,
                and the initiative suffers as a whole.

                Waypoint offers students and partnering organizations a simple information hub for finding and connecting with outreach programs.
                No longer do students risk the chance of not continuing their involment, and no longer do organizations
                have to jump through hurdles just to connect and collaborate with similar offerings in their
                area of operation.

              <h3>Process as a Product</h3>

              <p class="flow-text">
                The data that fuels Waypoint was created practically from scratch. We designed a method of data collection for the WWAMI
                Inititiave that enables them to collect clean, extensive information for an ever growing number
                of outreach programs. As more organizations provide this information, Waypoint will provide a
                greater wealth of information.

                  Creating a robust API for accessing the data collected allows future teams to utilize its potential to the fullest.
                          </p>
              </div>

              <p class="flow-text">
                Waypoint was built on the premise that good tools rely on good data. Knowing that organizational needs change, we made the
                database that houses all of the information we've gathered available as its own tool. Through
                our partner Seattle Data for Good, all of the details of this project and instructions for using
                the data derived from it will be made available to an entire community of innovators who will
                continue to help the WWAMI Initiative acheive its goal of eliminating the shortage of physicians
                in areas of need.
